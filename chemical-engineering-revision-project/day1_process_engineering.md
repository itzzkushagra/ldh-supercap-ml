# Day 1: Process Engineering Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic unit operations and their industrial applications
- Review process flow diagrams (PFDs) and piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs)
- Connect process design to economic considerations
- Prepare examples of process optimization

## Key Topics to Review

### Unit Operations
- Fluid flow systems (pumps, compressors, fans)
- Heat exchangers and fired heaters
- Separation processes (distillation, absorption, extraction)
- Mixing and agitation systems
- Solids handling (crushing, grinding, conveying)

### Process Design Concepts
- Material and energy balances
- Degree of freedom analysis
- Process simulation basics
- Equipment sizing fundamentals

### Business Connection Points
- How process efficiency impacts operational costs
- Capital vs. operating cost trade-offs
- Process intensification strategies
- Examples of process improvements leading to competitive advantage

## Daily Tasks
1. Review fundamental equations for each unit operation
2. Practice drawing simple PFDs for common processes
3. Research 2-3 real-world examples of process improvements
4. Prepare a 5-minute explanation of a familiar process from your experience

## Interview Preparation Questions
- Explain a process you've worked with/designed in simple terms
- How would you approach optimizing a chemical plant?
- What factors affect the choice of equipment in process design?

## Resources for Review
- Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook (relevant sections)
- Standard process design textbooks
- Industry case studies
