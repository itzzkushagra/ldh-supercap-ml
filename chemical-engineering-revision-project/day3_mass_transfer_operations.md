# Day 3: Mass Transfer Operations

## Learning Objectives
- Master separation processes and their applications
- Understand mass transfer principles and equipment design
- Connect separation efficiency to product quality and economics
- Prepare examples of separation optimization

## Key Topics to Review

### Mass Transfer Principles
- Diffusion mechanisms (Fick's law)
- Mass transfer coefficients
- Equilibrium stages and theoretical plates
- Operating lines and equilibrium curves

### Separation Processes
- Distillation (binary and multicomponent)
- Absorption and stripping
- Extraction and leaching
- Adsorption and membrane separations
- Crystallization and evaporation

### Equipment Considerations
- Column design (trays vs. packing)
- Mass transfer efficiency
- Pressure drop considerations
- Fouling and cleaning protocols

### Business Connection Points
- Product purity requirements and market value
- Energy intensity of separation processes
- Process integration opportunities
- Quality control and consistency

## Daily Tasks
1. Review mass transfer rate equations and applications
2. Practice distillation calculations (McCabe-Thiele method)
3. Analyze different separation alternatives for a given mixture
4. Prepare examples of separation process improvements
